# plume-move-clock-scope

`plume-move-clock-scope` treats chess and game engines as a local verification problem. The Elixir implementation is intentionally narrow, but the fixtures and notes make the behavior explicit.

## Plume Move Clock Scope Checkpoints

Treat the compact fixture as the contract and the extended examples as a scratchpad. The code should stay boring enough that a change in behavior is obvious from the test output.

## What This Is For

The repository exists to keep a technical idea small enough to reason about. The implementation avoids external dependencies where possible, then uses fixtures to make changes easy to review.

## Project Layout

- `lib`: library code
- `test`: language test directory
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Useful Pieces

- Includes extended examples for turn flow, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents search limits tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Architecture Notes

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The Elixir project uses Mix and ExUnit with clear data maps for each scenario.

## Tooling

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.

## Case Study

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Local Workflow

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Quality Gate

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Expansion Ideas

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more chess and game engines fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Scope

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.
